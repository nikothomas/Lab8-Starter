Service workers allow websites to respond to the user uninterrupted by network errors. This is key for graceful degradation, because it allows the website to respond even on systems that are having trouble communicating with the server or when certain failures occur as well as offloading tasks to the users browser. For example, I host a Galaxy Project server for genomics pipelines, and when the job node (or localhost if deployed and used on a single computer) does not have the resources to complete one part of the task it's desirable to have it fail while continuing to run parts of the pipeline that can be successfully completed. Additionally, when the server experiences high load it's desirable to allow the user to interact with the website and have it continue responding quickly to those interactions when possible.
